Arma 3 procedural &amp; persistent mission
Sort of a "Mike Force light". Intended to be something left running on a dedicated server, providing passive activity for players to join anytime and have something to do, while also having a larger goal for when the community organizes a session.

Players start at a base with the ability to purchase vehicles and training (medic, engineer, EOD, etc.),
and are provided with a constant set of side missions to complete, generated in proximity to the base. Rewarded with supply points used to make purchases and lowering the enemy strength.
When ready a "main operation" can be started. Being a mission requiring multiple objectes to be completed. Once complete, the operation area is marked as captured, expanding the area where side missions can generated.
*side missions generate in proxmity relative to all player controlled areas.
